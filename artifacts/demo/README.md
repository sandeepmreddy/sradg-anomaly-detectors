**Solution Overview:**
Our solution aims to identify anomalies in financial transactions by analyzing historical account data. 
We developed a robust script that reads account information from a CSV file, 
calculates the difference between two balance fields, 
and determines whether each transaction is a match or a break based on historical behavior. 
Specifically, it flags accounts as anomalous when a sudden deviation is observed 
after a consistent history of zero differences.
The complete codebase and demo are available in the linked Git repository.
